% First list title, author, and country. There are multiple options for

%
% booktitle: The simplist case. A book with one author, with no special
% characters in the title or author's name.
% booktitlelabel: Use if the title requires special handling, i.e. the label
% needs to be different than the printed title.
% booktitleauthor: Use if the author requires special handling, i.e. the label
% needs to be different than the printed name.
% booktitleauthortwo: Use if there are two authors, since they both require
% their own labels.
% booktitleauthorfive: Use if there are five authors.
% booktitlelabelauthor: Use if there title and author both require special
% handling.
% booktitlelabelauthortwo: Use if there are two authors and title and author
% both require special handling.
%
% Currently, there is no support for books with 3, 4, 6, or more authors, and no
% support for books with more than three authors and a title that needs special
% handling. This can be added relatively easily, though.
%
% Special handling is required in two cases. First, special characters (accents)
% must be stripped for labels. Second, authors with multiple last names
% (including 'Jr.' and the like) require a hypen to link those names together.
% This is required for proper sorting, which assumes the last word is the last

\section*{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The list serves to document every book I've ever read, including some that I started but didn't finish. Included with each book is some basic information about the book and what one could loosely define as a ``review''. These reviews sometime comprise my reactions to the book, sometimes contain the plot (including many spoilers!), and sometimes just explain the context around how I came to read the book. This type of information is interesting to probably just about nobody, and the original intended audience for this document was solely and singly myself. At a certain point, though, I realized that a limited number of people may have a passing interest in it, or at least in the scores or the source code. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.

There are a few technical details still worth mentioning. First, publication dates listed are usually for the first edition, even if I read a subsequent edition or revision. Second, \hyperref[sec:finished_category]{categorization} is somewhat arbitrary, both in terms of what categories I've listed and what books are listed as what. The \hyperref[category:nonfiction]{nonfiction} and \hyperref[category:novel]{novel} categories are perhaps a bit too all-inclusive, and there is plenty of debate about the line between novels and \hyperref[category:novella]{novellas}. Older works tend to have especially large room for debate as to the ``correct'' categorization. I've used the term ``\hyperref[category:collection]{collection}'' to include both short story collections as well as ``complete works'' compendiums, such as \hyperref[sec:Wolfgang Borchert]{Wolfgang Borchert}'s \textit{\hyperref[sec:Das Gesamtwerk]{Das Gesamtwerk}}, which may include short stories, poetry, essays, and more. In all of these matters, I made a decision simply to make a decision, and I'm not particularly invested in it, so if you want to argue, go right ahead.

Perhaps the largest opportunity for debate is the matter of nationality. I categorize books by the nation of origin of the author, which usually means where they spent most of their formative years, i.e.\ where they were raised and educated. This gets tricky with some authors, particularly those that split time between \hyperref[nation:England]{England}, \hyperref[nation:USA]{USA}, \hyperref[nation:Canada]{Canada}, or British colonies. For example, I list \hyperref[sec:Neil Young]{Neil Young} as Canadian, as that's where he grew up and where he still holds citizenship, despite that he has lived in California for almost his entire adult life. I list \hyperref[sec:Joseph Conrad]{Joseph Conrad} as \hyperref[nation:Poland]{Polish} and \hyperref[sec:Vladimir Nabokov]{Vladimir Nabokov} as \hyperref[nation:Russia]{Russian}, as those are the countries and cultures they were raised in. I have had extensive debates about the nationality of some authors that wrote in \hyperref[lang:German]{German} and lived in what was then \hyperref[nation:Austria]{Austro-Hungary} but is now an independent nation. This applies to \hyperref[sec:Franz Kafka]{Kafka}, \hyperref[sec:Rainer Maria Rilke]{Rilke}, and \hyperref[sec:Oedoen von Horvath]{Ödön von Horváth}, all of whom I once considered Austrian but have since been convinced otherwise. Works of fiction are categorized by the nation most relevant to the text, if applicable; otherwise by the origin of the author as with fiction. For biographies, I use the nationality of the subject, not the author.

The last matter is scoring. I use the Goodreads model, which is a five-point scale. 5 means great (I loved it), 4 means really good (I really liked it), 3 means good (I liked it), 2 means okay, and 1 means bad or disappointing. This is distinctly different from the scoring I use on my music review blog (\url{https://metronomicunderground.com/}), which is the letter grade system as explained on the \href{https://metronomicunderground.com/p/about.html}{About} page. I mention this because I have reviewed several \href{https://metronomicunderground.com/search/label/book%20review}{books about music} on the blog, and I had to figure out how to translate that scoring metric into this one. There is some inconsistency, but generally, A+/A = 5, A-/B+ = 4, B/B- = 3, C = 2, and D/F = 1.


% This label's pageref shows the end of the TOC instead of the start. Putting
% the label before the TOC makes it show the end of the intro, which is probably
% even less helpful.

Perhaps Schnitzler's most historically compelling and best play, despite that it is fairly uncharacteristic. It's his only play that has nothing to do with sexuality, and while he often writes about Jewish characters, this one focuses on anti-Semitism to a strong degree. In fact, it was so strong that the play was banned in Austria (until the monarchy fell in 1918) and copies of it were burned by the Nazis.

This is a collection of several poems, short stories, and a play, which includes everything published during the author's life and after his death until this was published. The author was originally an actor, but was conscripted in 1941. He went to the Eastern Front (i.e.\ Soviet Union) and continually clashed with the military and Nazi spirit, so he drifted between the front, jail, and illness. After the war, he supposedly walked the entire way home to Hamburg from Frankfurt am Main. His conditioned worsened (liver failure) and even a stay in a health resort in Basel did not prevent his death in 1947. Although he wrote some as a youth, his primary work is all from 1945 until his death.
